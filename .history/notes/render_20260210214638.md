No. Render deploys **once** when you push code to GitHub, then the app runs continuously as a web server.

**Here's the flow:**

1. **You push to GitHub** → Render detects the change
2. **Render deploys** (installs dependencies, runs your app)
3. **App runs 24/7** on Render's servers and handles user requests
4. **No redeploy on requests** — your app stays running, serving traffic

So users can access your app repeatedly without any redeploy happening.

**Important caveat for your app:**

Your app loads data from CSV files at startup:
```python
poverty_data = pd.read_csv(data_dir / 'PovStatsData.csv')
poverty = pd.read_csv(data_dir / 'poverty.csv', low_memory=False)
```

Make sure those CSV files are **committed to GitHub**, so they're included when Render clones your repo. If they're in .gitignore, Render won't have them and the app will crash.

Check:
```bash
git ls-files | grep .csv
```

If your CSVs aren't showing up, remove them from .gitignore (if they're there) and commit them.

The deployment appears to be stuck at the startup phase. This usually means your app is **still loading** — Render is waiting for the Dash server to fully start and bind to the port.

A few likely causes:

1. **Slow CSV loading** — Your app loads multiple large CSV files on startup:
   ```python
   poverty_data = pd.read_csv(data_dir / 'PovStatsData.csv')
   poverty = pd.read_csv(data_dir / 'poverty.csv', low_memory=False)
   ```

2. **Model training on startup** — Your logistic regression model trains every time the app starts, which can be slow

3. **First deployment** — Dependencies are being installed for the first time

**Quick fixes:**

**Option 1: Wait longer** 
- First deployments can take 5-10 minutes if loading/training is slow. Check the live logs on Render's dashboard for any errors.

**Option 2: Optimize startup (recommended)**
Pre-train the model and save it with `pickle`, so the app doesn't retrain on every startup:

```python
import pickle

# Train once
log_reg = LogisticRegression(random_state=42, max_iter=1000)
log_reg.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

# Save model
with open('model.pkl', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump((log_reg, scaler, features), f)

# Load model instead of retraining
with open('model.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    log_reg, scaler, features = pickle.load(f)
```

Would you like me to refactor your app to pre-train and pickle the model? That would speed up startup significantly.
