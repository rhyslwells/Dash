Try logistic regression example in dash.

Examples:
https://dash.gallery/Portal/?search=[ML]

Where is it hosted, is it on github?

Based on the information withing with repo i'd like to get an involved project to work on an improve.

And eexplore the use of dash.

What about if i wanted to host this on a server, how would i do that? To allow users to access it from the web?

Perfect! I've refactored your code into a clean, modular structure:

**New file structure:**
- **app.py** - Main entry point that ties everything together
- **config.py** - Constants and configuration (paths, model params, regions)
- **data.py** - Data loading and preparation functions
- **model.py** - `PovertyModel` class wrapping all ML logic
- **layout.py** - Dashboard layout and components
- **callbacks.py** - All interactive callbacks

**Key improvements:**
- Single responsibility: each file has one clear purpose
- Reusable `PovertyModel` class - easy to test or use elsewhere
- Clean separation of concerns - logic, data, UI, and interactivity are separate
- Easy to modify individual components without affecting others
- The old example.py is still there but can be removed once you verify the new app works

You can now run the app with:
```bash
python app.py
```

Would you like me to verify the imports work correctly, or would you like to make any adjustments to this structure?

Made changes.
